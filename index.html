Often, when people talk about travelling to Asia, the first country they might think of is to go to China,
Japan, Korea, Thailand, or some other places...</em></P>

<p class="green"><em>
<strong>BUT</strong>, if you would like to try <strong>REALLY TASTY, SOPHISTICATED,</strong>
most importantly, <strong>REALLY TRADITIONAL Chinese</strong>food, then you <strong>
should definately go to Taiwan !!!</strong>
</em></P>

<p class="blue"><em>
Since <strong>ancient Chinese culture including the ancient way of making Chinese food was never ruined and forgotten by the invasion of communism there</strong>, they have been <strong>WELL PRESERVED IN TAIWAN!!!</strong>
</em></p>

<em>As you might know, when it comes to eating, asians are extremely picky, and always know where to find THE BEST OF THE BEST food...<br></em></p>

<p class="blue">
<em><strong>That is why EVERY YEAR..  <br> MILLIONS OF ASIAN PEOPLE TRAVEL TO TAIWAN FOR TAIWANESE FOOD!!!</strong><br></em></p>

<p class="green">
<em><strong>EVEN THOUGH THEIR 
OWN FOOD IS ALREADY CONSIDERED TASTY TO THE WORLD.</strong></em>
<br></p>

<p class="blue">
<em>And that, it certainly <strong>INCLUDES CHINESE PEOPLE COMING FROM MAINLAND CHINA...
 </strong></em></p>

<p class="green">
<em><strong>THEY ALL CHOOSE TO COME TO TAIWAN FOR CHINESE FOOD...<br> 
DIDN'T IT RING YOU ANY BELL???</strong></em> </p>

<p class="blue"><em>
As for the landscapes of Taiwan ...<br>
if you prefer seeing sceneries and hate doing long distance travelling...then you should  <strong> ABSOLUTELY</strong>  go 
to Taiwan as well, because it's a country that has <strong>ALL TYPES</strong>  of scenarios, that are <strong>ALL NEARBY FROM ONE ANOTHER</strong> ... and that includes</em></p> 

<h3 id="views">
<ul><em> 
  <li>High Mountains</li> 
  <li>Astonishing Cliffs</li> 
  <li>Giant Trees</li>
  <li>White Sand Beaches</li>
  <li>Palm Trees......too many to name...</li>
</em></ul>
